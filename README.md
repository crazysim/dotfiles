# Dotfiles

These are my dotfiles. You'll need the files for vundle going for Vim and
exuberant-ctags installed and in the $PATH for the Git stuff. Vundle will take
care of installing everything for vim and git does a ctags-update thing
automatically when committing. I commit when I really mean save. Also, files in
here are meant to be symlinked to the correct paths after cloning. I don't do
this often enough to make a script but they should all be symlinked by links in
the home directory.
